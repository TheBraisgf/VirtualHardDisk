# ðŸ’¾ Virtual Hard Disk ðŸ’½

Welcome to the Virtual Hard Disk project! 
This project is a backend API developed as part of the Hack a Boss full-stack bootcamp. 

It allows users to easily register and log in, upload and download files, and create and delete folders. 

In February, we will be building a frontend using React to complete the project. 

The Virtual Hard Disk is a powerful tool that provides a secure and convenient way to manage your virtual storage needs. 

Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone looking for an easy way to organize your files and folders, the Virtual Hard Disk has you covered. 

We can't wait to see what you can do with it!

## Deployment

To deploy this project you must first create a MySQL database with the name you have given it in the .env file


```bash
  CREATE DATABASE MYSQL_BBDD
```
Now you must run the following command to start the database and create the tables
```bash
  npm run initDB
```
Finally run the server:
